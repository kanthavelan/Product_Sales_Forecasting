Product sales forecasting

Problem Statement
In the competitive retail industry, the ability to predict future sales accurately is crucial for operational and strategic planning. Product sales forecasting aims to estimate the number of products a store will sell in the future, based on various influencing factors such as store type, location, regional characteristics, promotional activities, and temporal variations (such as holidays and seasons). This project focuses on developing a predictive model that uses historical sales data from different stores to forecast sales for upcoming periods.
Need and Use of Product Sales Forecasting
Effective sales forecasting is fundamental for multiple aspects of retail management and operation, including:
1.	Inventory Management: Accurate sales forecasts help ensure that stores maintain optimal inventory levelsâ€”enough to meet customer demand without overstocking, which can lead to increased costs or waste, especially in the case of perishable goods.
2.	Financial Planning: Forecasting sales allows businesses to estimate future revenue and manage budgets more effectively. This is crucial for allocating resources to areas such as marketing, staffing, and capital investments.
3.	Marketing and Promotions: Understanding when sales peaks and troughs are likely to occur enables retailers to plan effective marketing campaigns and promotional offers to boost revenue or manage customer flow.
4.	Supply Chain Optimization: Sales forecasts inform production schedules, logistics, and distribution plans, ensuring that products are available where and when they are needed, thereby reducing transportation and storage costs.
5.	Strategic Decision Making: Long-term sales forecasting supports broader business strategies, including store expansions, market entry, and other capital expenditures.

I tried to add final_model.pkl to GitHub, but it was not allowed due to its size. So, I uploaded it to Google Drive and shared the link here.
